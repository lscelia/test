#The smoking trend in the US over 5 years 
let's clean the dataset for observing the smoking trends in these five years 
lets select the relavant questions first and the following explain the details of the variables
smoking_status: current smoking stastus.

After knowing the overall trend... let's observe the distribution of smoking. 
In order to know their distribution, we have to obtain the information of their age, race and sex. 
We can group by these categories and making a distribution plot.
```{r}
#function creating the same table to find the distribution
#first do some data cleaning

         #since 1,2 represents current daily/occasional smokers whereas 3,4 is former smoker and never smoke respectively; we define 1,2 as smoker whereas 3,4 as non-smoker
         smoking_status = 
           case_when(smoking_status == "1"|smoking_status == "2"~ "smoker",
